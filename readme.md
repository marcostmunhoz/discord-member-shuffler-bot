# Discord Member Shuffler Bot

### A simple bot to that prints a shuffled server member list, with some optional filters.

## Usage
- `npm run watch` (on development environment) or `npm start` (on production environments).

Note: The script uses two environment variables in order to work: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID`. Both can be obtained by creating a [Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
